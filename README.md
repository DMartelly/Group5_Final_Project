#N-Length-Nodes

This program finds all paths of length N there are in a given undirected graph from A to B, and displays each unique path. This was my parallel computing program for Structure Computing Organization at FIU

##Running the Program
To run program:\n
./main\n
	-t: print time only\n
	-d: default count to 10, path to 2\n
	-g: preform calculations on GPU only\n
	-s: show paths\n
	-c [num of nodes]\n
	-p [num of paths]\n
	-a [start node number (0 to c-1)]\n
	-b [end node number (0 to c-1)]\n
